## HOW TO GET THE IMAGE

So the subject specifies that you need penultimate version of Debian, right now it is Bullseye, but it might change soon, so here is how to get the version you might need in the future.

#### 1. Go to [Debian Releases](https://www.debian.org/releases/) 
#### 2. Click on version you need in my case [Debian 11 bullseye](https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/) 
#### 3. Click on [installation information](https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/debian-installer/)
#### 4. Click on [amd64](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/archive/11.7.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-11.7.0-amd64-netinst.iso) and download the image
